		DevOps Service from Cloud Service Providers : Managed Services :
		
			-> Azure DevOps Services 		#  1st Preference!
			
			-> AWS DevOps Services 			# 
			
	DevOps Implementation :::
	
	How to Choose the DevOps Services (Open-Source vs Managed_Services) ?
	
	- Need to do a detailed DevOps Assessment!
	
		- Based on the DevOps Assessment, we can recommended the DevOps Tools & Services.
					
	DevOps Assessment ???
	
		DevOps Lead/Architect/Consultant ::

			--> Interact with all the stakeholders.
			
			--> Tools 
			
			--> Current Development/Build/Test/Deployment Process 
			
			--> Build and Release Environments and Frequencies 
			
			--> Key Performance Metrics
				- MTTR 
		
			--> IAAS / PAAS / SAAS ---> Customers/Client & Vendor/AWS Cloud Service Provider 

		DevOps Assessment Report with the recommendations!

	DevOps :::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy which helps to promote the collaboration between the Teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		Teams involved in the overall SDLC Process :
		
			DevOps Team 
				Infra-Structure Management Team 
				Application Development Team 
				Testing Team
				Release Management Team
				Production Support Team 
				Production Monitoring Team 
				IT Security Team 
		
		Environments :::
		
			Non-Prod Environments					Production Environments
			
				Dev 
				Build 
				Test 
					QA 
					UAT 			============>		Production Servers
	
	
	
	- Hybrid Environment :
	
		Azure Cloud & On-Prem Servers
		
			AzPipeline ==> Parallel Deployment
